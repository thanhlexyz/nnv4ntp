\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
We presented a formal verification framework for deep learning–based mobile traffic prediction, enabling provable robustness against adversarial traffic injection. By encoding input perturbations and defining output properties that enforce resource allocation bounds, our approach leverages NeuralSAT to provide sound robustness guarantees. Evaluation on the Telecom Italia Milan dataset reveals an asymmetric robustness profile: the model is resilient to overestimation under moderate perturbations but highly vulnerable to underestimation attacks.
Future work will extend this study with more comprehensive evaluations across a wider range of datasets and models to generalize our findings and improve robustness in diverse network scenarios.
